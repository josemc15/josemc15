DAY-1

1.sql
sql is stands by structured query language.
Its manipulate database.
It can be used to create , read,update and delete database records.

2.normalization:
It is the process to elimate the redundancy and
It also helps organising the data in the database.
insertion anomaly,update anomaly and deletion anomaly it is adatabase design techquie.

3.constraints in sql:
It are used to specify rules for the data in the table.

1.notnull
colwmn value not have a null value.

2.unique
all value in a column be a unique it means diferent values.

3.primary key
It uniquely identified each record in table.

4. forign key
foriegn key is used to link two tables and it refer primary key.

5.check
that values in a column satisfies a specfic condition.

6.default
It set a default value for a column when no value is specified.

7.index
use to create and return data from database quickly.


4.Datatypes.

The data types define column that values can hold integer,charater, date and time ,binary and so on.
Each cowmn in a database table is required a name and datatypes.

CHARACTER:
STRING LETTER,NUMBER AND SYMBOLS 
DATA TYPE ARE
CHAR,VARCHAR 

NUMERIC:
THE extract datatypes are
SMALLINT,INTEGER,BIGINT,NUMERIC,DECIMAL

DATETIME:
It contains date and time both values.


DAY-2

1.CREATING DATABASE:

QUERY:
CREATE DATABASE database name;

CREATING TABLE:

QUERY:
CREATE TABLE table_name(column1 datatype,......);



2.INSERT INTO

Inserting column values and data's

QUERY:
INSERT INTO table name values ('','','',....);

3.SELECT 
  Select statement is used to select data from database.

QUERY:
SELECT column,... 
from table_name

select over all table function
SELECT * FROM table_name

4.DELETE
Delete existing records from tables.

QUERY:
DELETE FROM table_name 
Where column's


DAY 3

1.WHERE CLAUSE

It used for filter records.
It used to extract only those records that specfied condition.

QUERY:
SELECT column1,...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


2.UPDATE CLAUSE

THIS statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

QUERY:
UPDATE table_name
Set column1= value1,....
where condition,



3.SQL OPERATORS:

THE WHERE clause can be combined with AND,OR, Between and NOT operators.

The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition.

The NOT operators display record if the condition is NOT TRUE.

BETWEEN	TRUE if the operand is within the range of comparisons.

LIKE	TRUE if the operand matches a pattern

4.HAVING CLAUSE:

Having clause is used in combination with group byto impose condition on groups.

QUERY:



 DAY 4

2.SQL ORDER BY

The ordered  by column1,column2 ascending and descending order by default .
ASC
DESC

QUERY:
select*from student order by table_name asc;
select*from student order by table_name desc;

SQL GROUP BY

The group by statement is `often aggregate functions
COUNT(),- counting data
MAX(), - maximum function returns largest value of the selected column
MIN(),- smallest value of the selected column
SUM(),-total sum 
AVG().

QUERY:
SELECT column_name,COUNT() as column_name
from table_name 
group by column_name;


1.change Date of birth to Age
select datediff(year,Date_of_birth,getdate())as age 
from Table_name.

1.Data definition language:

DDL commands help to define the structure of the databases or schema.

CREATE: It is used to create a new database and its objects such as table, views, function, stored procedure, triggers, etc.
DROP: It is used to delete the database and its objects, including structures, from the server permanently.
ALTER: It's used to update the database structure by modifying the characteristics of an existing attribute or adding new attributes.
TRUNCATE: It is used to completely remove all data from a table, including their structure and space allocates on the server.
RENAME: This command renames the content in the database.

Why we use DDL commands?
The following are the reasons to use DDL commands:
It allows us to store shared data in a database.
It improved integrity due to the data independence feature.
It will enable multiple users to work on the same databases.
It improved security efficient data access.

2.Data Manipulate language:
SELECT: This command is used to extract information from a table.
INSERT: It is a SQL query that allows us to add data into a table's row.
UPDATE: This command is used to alter or modify the contents of a table.
DELETE: This command is used to delete records from a database table, either individually or in groups.
